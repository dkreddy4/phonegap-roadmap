## View the Roadmap

Browse the  [Zenhub Boards][boards].

If you don't have [Zenhub installed][zenhub], then you can view the unordered [Milestones][milestones].

## Setup

Install the free [Zenhub Chrome Extension][zenhub] to view the milestones and issues as [Boards][boards].

_We use Zenhub because Github does not support ordering of Github milestones or issues._

## Terminology

- **Boards** are [Zenhub Boards][boards] that display the priority from left-to-right (**Milestones**) and top-to-down (**Projects**).
- **Milestones** are [Github Milestones][milestones] that are major releases that we can announce to our users.
- **Projects** are [Github Issues][issues] that are individual project releases that lead to a **Milestone** release.
