# PhoneGap Roadmap

> Upcoming milestones and projects for PhoneGap

![Zenhub Board Screenshot][screenshot]

## Overview

The PhoneGap roadmap is best viewed as [Boards][boards]

If you don't have [Zenhub][zenhub] installed, then you can view the unordered [Milestones][milestones].

## Terminology

- **Milestones** are [Github Milestones][milestones] that are major releases that we can announce to our users.
- **Projects** are [Github Issues][issues] that are individual project releases that lead to a **Milestone** release.
- **Boards** are [Zenhub Boards][boards] that display the priority from left-to-right (**Milestones**) and top-to-down (**Projects**).

## Setup

Install the free [Zenhub Chrome Extension][zenhub] to view the milestones and issues as [Boards][boards].

_We use Zenhub because Github does not support ordering of Github milestones or issues._
