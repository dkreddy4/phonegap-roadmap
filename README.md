## Terminology

- **Milestones** are [Github Milestones](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-roadmap/milestones) that are major releases that we can announce to our users.
- **Projects** are [Github Issues](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-roadmap/issues) that are individual project releases that lead to a **Milestone** release.
- **Boards** are [Zenhub Boards](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-roadmap#boards) that display the priority from left-to-right (milestones) and top-to-down (projects).

## Setup

Install the free [Zenhub Chrome Extension](https://www.zenhub.io/) to view the milestones and issues as [Boards](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-roadmap#boards).

_We use Zenhub because Github does not support ordering of Github milestones or issues._
